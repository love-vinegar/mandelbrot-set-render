# mandelbrot-set-render
this is extention for my mmandelbrot / julia set veiwer and it renders all of your *.mbs files 

when you open the app you must write path where are all of yur *.mbs, files (files you can get from my mandelbrot/julia set app).
Then you just wait and everything renders and save to the plase of your *.mbs files.

for app to work properly all of the files skoul have last to characters in name numbers (all diferent).
